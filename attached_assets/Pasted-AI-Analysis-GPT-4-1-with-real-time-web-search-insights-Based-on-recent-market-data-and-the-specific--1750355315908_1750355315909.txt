"narrative": "The valuation of the 160-acre property in Creighton, NE, is influenced by several factors. Recent data indicates that non-tillable grazing land in Nebraska has experienced a 5% increase in value, averaging $1,175 per acre as of February 1, 2025. This upward trend is attributed to strong cattle prices and increased demand for grazing land.

The most likely estimate (P50) is $1,200 per acre, considering current market conditions and the property's characteristics.
